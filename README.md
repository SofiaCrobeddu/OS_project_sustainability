# OS_project_sustainability

This individual project was carried out for the course of International organizations in producing Official Statistics for the 6 free credits of the Master's degree in Data science at Sapienza University of Rome. It was made at the end of the second semester of the academic year 2023-2024 (June 2024).

## PURPOSE

The aim of this project is to examines the sustainability of Colombiaâ€™s agriculture for the environmental dimension, focusing also on an analysis of water stress in the second part. In the first part this environmental dimension is measured through four proxy sub-indicators, and the trend and status assessment. In the second part of the prject, instead, I try to make a prediction of the Water Stress Level indicator , doing also a preliminary reflexion on avocado production, in 2030 (the year of the SDGs Agenda).

## REPOSITORIES

The macro-repositories are:
- **data**: it contains the csv files with the original datasets. The files and repositories with data inside, are the following ones:
  - `colombia_emissions_total_CO2.csv`: contains Colombia's total emissions of CO2. These data were needed to calculate the Greenhouse Gas Emission, since they represent the numerator of this proxy sub-indicator. From FAOstat.
  - `colombia_fertilizer_use_intensity.csv`: contains Colombia's fertilizer use intensity. From FAOstat.
  - `colombia_pesticides_use_intensity.csv`: contains Colombia's pesticides use intensity. From FAOstat.
  - `colombia_value_prod_agriculture.csv`: contains Colombia's value of agricultural production. These data were needed to calculate the Greenhouse Gas Emission, since they represent the denominator of this proxy sub-indicator. From FAOstat.
  - `colombia_water_stress.csv`: contains Colombia's water stress. From FAOstat.
  - There are also two other internal repositories:
     - **water stress - World Bank**: it contains the dataset `water stress and variables - WB.csv` regarding data for water stress level for Colombia, from World Bank databases. Comapred to the dataset from FAOstat, this one contains more specific information such as "Annual freshwater withdrawals, agriculture (% of total freshwater withdrawal)", "Annual freshwater withdrawals, domestic (% of total freshwater withdrawal)", "Annual freshwater withdrawals, industry (% of total freshwater withdrawal)", "Annual freshwater withdrawals, total (billion cubic meters)", "Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources", "Renewable internal freshwater resources, total (billion cubic meters)", "Average precipitation in depth (mm per year)", "Population, total", "GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)", "Population density (people per sq. km of land area)".
     - **ML_part**: it contains the dataset `data_cleaned.csv` that comes from the previous one mentioned before (`water stress and variables - WB.csv`), after renaiming columns, converting in number the observations and reindexing.
- **script**: it contains the
